## Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.                                                              
2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.                                                                         
3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.                                                    
4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.                                                                 
5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.

Check Leap Year

Objective: To determine if a given year is a leap year.
Approach:
A leap year is divisible by 4. However, if it is also divisible by 100, it must additionally be divisible by 400 to qualify as a leap year. The program will take a year as input and return whether it is a leap year or not.
Sum of Two Numbers

Objective: To compute the sum of two numbers provided by the user.
Approach:
The user will input two numbers. The program will add them and display the result.
Multiplication Table

Objective: To generate the multiplication table for a given number.
Approach:
The user will input a number. The program will calculate and print the product of the number with integers from 1 to 10.
HCF and LCM of Two Numbers

Objective: To calculate the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two input numbers.
Approach:
HCF: Find the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
LCM: Find the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
The program will take two numbers as input, calculate their HCF and LCM, and display the results.
Sum of Numbers Until ‘x’

Objective: To sum a sequence of numbers entered by the user until the user decides to stop.
Approach:
The program will continuously take numbers as input. When the user inputs ‘x’, it will stop taking inputs and display the total sum of all numbers entered.
